<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hey there, I'm Adiakri! I'm 25 years old and I'm really into technology and music. By day, I'm a full-stack developer, and I've got a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a focus on Human Resources Management.
</p>

<p>
  But when I'm not coding and working on tech projects, you'll often find me jamming out on the lead guitar or piano. I love music, and it's my way of balancing out the analytical side of my job with some creative expression.
</p>

<p>
  Oh, and I'm also a bit of a gamer. I enjoy playing computer games not just for fun, but also because they keep my problem-solving and strategic thinking skills sharp.
</p>

<p>
  One thing I'm proud of is my strong emotional intelligence. It's a skill that comes in handy in both the tech world and my interactions with people. I like to think it sets me apart as a developer who can connect with others and understand their needs.
</p>

<p>
  So, that's a bit about me tech enthusiast, musician, gamer, and someone who values connecting with people. Nice to meet you!"
